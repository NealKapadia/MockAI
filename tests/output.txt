giddy in spirit still gazing in a doubt
whether till the next turning of all on your left marry at
the very tyranny and rage of his

duke

be nominated in the laws of venice
must needs tell thee more of this present question with the braver grace
and speak between the owners and their followers

bassanio

most worthy gentleman
according to my
description level at my affections passions fleet to air
as doubtful whether what i see be true
until confirmd signd ratified by you

portia

you press me far and therefore forbear awhile
theres something which to term in gross
is an unlessond girl unschoold unpractised
happy in this she is not bred so dull but she can learn
happiest of all is that her gentle spirit
commits itself to yours to be directed
how i shall think we are accomplished
with that keen appetite that he sits down
where is the peril of waters
winds and rocks the man is notwithstanding use your
pleasure if your love

bassanio

tis not unknown to you antonio
i know he will choose it i will do any
thing nerissa ere ill be married to a sponge

nerissa

there do i choose and thrive i as i may

portia

too long a pause for that i thank you madam give welcome notwithstanding
sufficient three thousand ducats here is six

shylock

i am debating of my love
there must be something
grow to he had a kind of devil and to
run away from the gallows did his fell soul fleet
and whilst thou layst in thy unhallowd dam
infused itself in thee for thy desires
are wolvish bloody starved and ravenous

shylock

i cannot find her

shylock

till thou canst get a wife

gratiano

gratiano

nerissa cheer yon stranger cur
over your threshold moneys is your spirits

to wish myself much better the instructions i can easier teach
twenty what were good to
do chapels had been churches and poor mens
cottages princes palaces it
